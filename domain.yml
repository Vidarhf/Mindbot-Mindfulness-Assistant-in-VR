  utter_greet:
  - text: This is Uberduck. It's a synthetic speech toy. I started working on Uberduck in 2020 with the goal of creating a friendly, creative, open-ended dialog agent. I built an interactive audio chatbot over WebRTC that generated text responses with a Transformer model and synthesized them to audio, but I found that speech synthesis was the most exciting part of the project.
